  "text": "Methods\n Bis(hydroxyethyl)aminotris(hydroxymethyl)methane, (BT) buffer (Fluka) was used and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.4 by addition of diluted HCl.\n Preparation of the Cr(V) compound [CrV-BT]2-\n [CrV-BT]2- was prepared in situ from a Cr(V) precursor, Na [CrVO(ehba)2] (ehba = sodium bis(2-ethyl-2-hydroxybutanoate)oxochromato(V)), following a method described elsewhere [13].\n Animals and Treatment\n The in vivo studies were carried out on 10 (per group) sexually mature 60-day-old male ICR-CD1 mice (Harlan Interfauna Iberica SA, Barcelone, Spain). Mice were housed at a constant temperature (22 +2°C), relative humidity (40–60%) vivarium on a light-dark 12 h/12 h cycle; water and food were provided ad libitum; animals were allowed to acclimatise for one week before experimental use. After this period one group of mice was subcutaneously injected daily with a dose of 8 μmol of Cr/mouse over 5 days [15]. A control group of animals was similarly injected with the vehicle (0.5 mL BT). On day six, all animals were sacrificed, under ether anaesthesia, for testis and epididymis removal.\n All assays with animals were conducted in accordance with the institutional guidelines for ethics in animal experiments (Rule n° 86/609/CEE – 24/11/92).\n Ultrastructural studies\n Body and organ weights were recorded. Some fragments of testis and cauda epididymis were fixed by immersion in 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 2 hours, postfixed with osmium tetroxide, and routinely prepared for transmission electron microscopy studies. Semithin sections, made with a Supernova Reichert ultramicrotome, were stained with toluidine blue for light microscopy observation. Ultrathin sections (golden colour of interference) were also prepared using a diamond knife. Then, these sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and observed under a Hitachi electron microscope at 100 kV.\n Sperm motility\n Both epididymides were removed to a Petri dish containing Modified Tyrode's medium prepared according to Fraser [25]. The cauda epididymis was disrupted through an incision with a scissors previously wrapped with Parafilm®, and was kept for 30 min at 35°C to promote the release of sperm into the medium. Then, sperm were collected with a micropipette (aliquot 20 μl) to a slide for motility analysis. Sperm motility was determined by counting all progressive sperm, the non-progressive and the immotile sperm in the same field. In each preparation at least 100 sperm was counted. This motility assessment was repeated in a new preparation from the same semen sample.\n Sperm concentration\n A small amount of sperm suspension was collected with a tube and was centrifuged for 5 min to 1000 g. The pellet was suspended in new media. A small amount (20 μL) of suspension was diluted 1:1 with distilled water. The sperm concentration was determined by counting the number of cells on a haemocytometer (Neubauer Improved Chamber).\n Acrosome integrity\n Acrosome integrity was determined according to Lu and Shur [26]. The sperm were fixed in 5% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 23°C. Fixed sperm were collected by centrifugation at 1000 g for 5 min and were then resuspended in 500 μL 0.1 M ammonium acetate pH 9.0. Sperm were washed once on the buffer and then resuspended in 100 μL ammonium acetate. An aliquot (20 μL) of this suspension was dried on a glass slide and was stained for 2 min at 23°C with 0.22 Coomassie blue G250 in 50% methanol/10% glacial acetic acid. After staining, the slides were rinsed with tap water, air-dried and mounted. The acrosome integrity was assayed by an intense staining on the anterior region of sperm head under 400× magnification.\n In the F3 generation, vinclozolin lineage males had a significantly higher rate of prostate disease (p<0.01) compared to the controls, Fig 1B. Transgenerational prostate disease affected roughly 50% of the F3 vinclozolin lineage males, Table 1 and S3 Table.",
